# reactjs-fullstack-tdd-kata
## Description
This Kata is set up initially to stretch your skills by working with [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), and [Test Driven Development](http://wiki.c2.com/?TestDrivenDevelopment).

- If you prefer something other than GraphQL, well you forked it, test drive a REST service instead!
    - *you can still use [supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) to drive outside tests for REST or other APIs*
- I will be adding more test lib/framework support or improvements to this kata, check out the [TODOs](https://github.com/dschinkel/reactjs-fullstack-tdd-kata/projects/1)

## 🪛 Initial Setup ||

### Mac:
- Install Homebrew (run this cmd from terminal): `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
- Install Yarn: `brew install yarn`

### Windows PC:
- Install yarn somehow 🤣

### Finally (from cmd line):
- **install node modules**: `yarn`
- **Make sure you can run the tests**: scripts are in `package.json`, look there

#### Note:
- No, **TypeScript** is _not_ setup, this is a simple kata.  Add that setup yourself 😎
- **_If you're ever stuck on this Kata_**, feel free to Join the [WeDoTDD.com Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/wedotdd/shared_invite/zt-ladr0ati-rD4bNNEx_Uu1v0pZsxZDNQ) and well give you some pointers on it!

## 🧪 Tests

Testing frameworks already setup for you [mocha](https://mochajs.org), [chai](https://www.chaijs.com), and [supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest)

Out-of-box Hello World tests demonstrate `Arrange` / `Act` / `Assert` partitioning

#### Client

- You can use [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com) or a newer, better lib called [isolate-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/isolate-components)
    - Note: Will be adding [enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme) examples soon

#### Server
- Initial **server-side** spec for "Hello World" is directly testing the service contract
    - Tests are isolated & headless
        - So there no need to run real the thing just to write and run your tests
            - no need to run the graphQL service to run tests.
            - front-end tests do not rely on running the site or on webdriver
            - 
## 🏃🏻‍♀️ Run the Website (optional)
*(not required during TDD)* 

#### See it in action 
1. Run *GraphQL Service*: `yarn start-service`
    - Don't forget about the `GraphiQL tool`, go to `http://localhost:4000/graphql`
2. Run *front-end*: `yarn start` 
    - Note: uses [webpack dev server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server)
    - GraphQL Service ☝ (step 1)️ must be running

## Kata Requirements for "Coffee Roasters Website" ☕️
*If you don't like Coffee, tough luck!*

Implement the following features below.  

#### 🖥 Requirements
- Implement it with [Test Driven Development](http://wiki.c2.com/?TestDrivenDevelopment)
- Front-end should call the backend to get the data -OR- implement it without a backend (use test data and stubs)
- Hint: You can copy the feature names below, and literally use them as your very outside test names!

### 📜 Feature Slices
#### ~~Feature #1: Shows the text "Hello World"~~   `Done for you`
#### `Feature #2`: Shows a list of Coffee Roasters
#### `Feature #3`: Clears Roasters
#### `Feature #4`: Filters list by Roaster Name
#### `Feature #5`: Shows a *paged* list of Coffee Roasters
#### `Feature #6`: Goes to next paged list of roasters
#### `Feature #7`: Goes to previous paged list of roasters list
#### `Feature #8`: Shows Roaster Details
- ability to select a roaster somehow to see their detail page
- detail page should show a couple of roasts (e.g. Dark Roast, Light Roast)
